						<h1 class="name" style="margin-top: 30px;"><b>Owner: Lykos Sarpedon</b></h1>
						<p class="description" >Lykos Sarpedon stepped into the world Alya Kemi and thought "Why just me?"
							And so brought forth more and more people to inhabit his world. He nurtured along the society with the creation of a psuedo-economic system using diamonds as currency. Alya Kemi's population
							rose and fell under the watchful eye of Sarpedon. Creators came and went, but the following creators listed will be those 
							that still thrive under the harsh rule of Lykos Sarpedon.

						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: The Armourman</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > The Armourman was a sturdy man who journeyed far and short, looking a sense of purpose. One day as The Armourman was fishing, he was hailed by man to come aboard from a passing boat. Bounding to his feet,
							he ran to his shop and began collecting his tools and equipment he might need for an adventure. Upon hopping into his boat and drawing astern to the other boat, he found out that Lykos Sarpedon was calling on him to start civilization 
							far to the south. The Armourman agreed readily, knowing he had found his purpose.

						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: BrennanKunkel</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > After much of the civilization had been established, BrennanKunkel fell from the sky and face planted onto the soil of Alya Kemi. As a few residents gathered around him, he looked up and rasped, "Am I safe?" then he 
							collapsed. He woke up in a warm bed, wondering where he was. Upon being questioned, he told his tale, how he had come from a land ruled justly by King Urn. Then, they were beset upon by wild beasts. After a fierce battle, BrennanKunkel had launched himself into the air
							and tried to glide to safety. Sadly his elytra had malfunctioned and he had crash landed to this land. Upon being informed that this was Alya Kemi, and that they did not know where he was from, they advised him to stay and help the land grow.

							<p class="description" >
								Crack! "TIMBER!" was the shout from Durveathor as he felled a mighty oak. He quickly chopped up the log and stacked it. He then hefted his axe and walked towards house in the growing dusk. He saw a help wanted poster tacked to his door. After reading that a lumberman was greatly need in a land called
								Alya Kemi, he was overjoyed and sent a letter informing Sarpedon of his acceptance. That night, he was bringing some wood in from his fire when suddenly there was a flash of light and a loud "BANG!" He was thrown forward, crashing into a tree. He rose to his feet dazed, and saw a horde of creepers closing in on him. He sprinted to his house, 
								grabbed his axe and some food and left the area, leaving behind all of his worldly goods. He followed the map that was from the message and was able to Journey to Alya Kemi. He found Lykos and told him of his predicament. Lykos assured him that he would be able to create an even bigger logging business then what he had lost.
								Durveathor then settled an area and putting his mighty axe to work.

						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: Feanor</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > Feanor was tending to his horses, when suddenly a fierce storm struck. Much of his herd escaped, even his valued steed, Arbiter. Distraught, he began searching everywhere. He left his foot prints on every hill, valley, and glade. Distraught as he was, he had begun his 
							journey ill prepared. He had brought barely any food and when he ran out, he began to grow hungry. He had sat on a fallen tree, his mind filled with worries when a hand had reached down to him. He accepted it and allowed it to pull him up. It was Lykos, and in tow he had Feanors horse Arbiter! 
							After discussion, Feanor accepted Lykos proposition to journey to Alya Kemi and help outfit the land with forms of needed transportation. They mounted to horses and rode fast towards the rising sun, towards Alya Kemi.

						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: General Sarbina</b></h1>
							<p class="description" >
								Over the clash of swords and screams of men, General Sarbina rallied his men to the flag. Then after a final charge, they burst the enemies ranks and quickly destroyed the rest of the opposing army. After the battle ended, he orated a magnificent speech to his army. The conclusion of
								the speech was met with a great many cheers. He then left and leaped astride his charger and began a slow trot. His thoughts were filled with sadness over the loss of life that had occurred earlier. Alone, he allowed himself to weep freely. Remembering an old friends offer, he wrote a message telling of 
								his decision. He placed this message by a flower and began his journey away from war and destruction and towards peace and the construction of a world. Towards Alya Kemi.

							<p class="description" >
								After a particularly tragic accident in which Lord Bard lost all of the treasure that he was holding. He walked dejectedly back to his hut. He opened the door and opened his chest and rummaged for some food. Finding some, he began to munch on it. Suddenly, he was shot in the shoulder by a skeleton archer. Unfortunately
								he had left the door open and the monsters in the night had begun to attack him. Fleeing out the back door, he ran into the darkness, being battered and bruised by the monsters as he ran. Splashing into a river he swam to the other side. He yelped as more monsters began to appear around him. Thinking fast, he built a boat
								and used it to sail swiftly away from the monsters. Eventually he reached the sea and he began drifting, no longer cognizant of where he was. Days passed and soon a giant structure loomed on the horizon. Filled with hope he paddled to it. He was met by Lykos Sarpedon. Before Lord Bard could speak, Lykos announced that he was looking for 
								brave men to fill his world. Lord Bard opened his mouth to say that he was not altogether brave, but Lykos shushed him. Lord Bard began his new life, albeit still filled with tragic accidents, in Alya Kemi.

							<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: Red_Ninja2</b></h1>
							<p class="description" >
								"Tink, tink, tink", rang Red_Ninja2's pickaxe as he mined some glowstone. He bagged his treasure and looked around suspiciously, hearing naught except the eery ambience of the Nether. He turned back around and came face to face with a single pigman! He recoiled and swung at him with his pic-axe, landing a glancing blow. Only minorly damaged,
								the enraged pigman squealed, calling forth any nearby pigmen. Frightened now, Red_Ninja2 ran and clambered through the nether, avoiding the lakes of lava as he went. He stopped at the edge of such a lake and spotted an unkown portal off in the distance.
 								His lack of movement nearly cost him his life as he was struck from behind and knocked into the lava. He quickly retrieved an ender pearl and threw it towards the portal, hoping his aim was true. It was, and he quickly clambered through the portal.
 								He was met by Lykos, who had just finished planting a tree by the portal. He gazed at Red_Ninja2 and said, "Welcome."
 								"Welcome."
