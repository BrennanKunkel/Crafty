					<article>
						<h1 class="name" style="margin-top: 30px;"><b>Owner: Lykos Sarpedon</b></h1>
						<p class="description" >Lykos Sarpedon stepped into the world Alya Kemi and thought "Why just me?"
							And so brought forth more and more people to inhabit his world. He nurtured along society with the creation of a psuedo-economic system using diamonds as currency. Alya Kemis population
							rose and fell under the watchful eye of Sarpedon. Creators came and went, but the following creators listed will be those 
							that still thrive under the harsh rule of Lykos Sarpedon. Main occupation: Cruel Tyrant.
						</p>
					
						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: The Armourman</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > The Armourman was a sturdy man who journeyed far and short, looking a sense of purpose. One day as The Armourman was fishing, he was hailed by man  to come aboard from a passing boat. Bounding to his feet,
							He ran to his shop and began collecting his tools and equipment he might need for an adventure. Upon hopping into his boat and drawing astern to the other boat, he found out that Lykos Sarpedon was calling on him to start civilization 
							far to the south. The Armourman agreed readily, knowing he had found his purpose. Main occupation: Adventurer.
						</p>
						
						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: BrennanKunkel</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > After much of the Civilization had been established, BrennanKunkel fell from the sky and face planted onto the soil of Alya Kemi. As a few residents gathered around him, he looked up and rasped, "Am I safe?". Then he 
							collapsed. He woke up in a warm bed, wondering where he was. Upon being questioned, he told his tale, how he had come from a land ruled justly by King Urn. Then, they were beset upon by wild beasts. After a fierce battle, BrennanKunkel had launched himself into the air
							and tried to glide to safety. Sadly his elytra had malfunctioned and he had crash landed to this land. Upon being informed that this was Alya Kemi, and that they did not know where he was from, they advised him to stay and help the land grow. Main occupation: Beef Farmer.
						</p>
						
						<h1 class="name"><b>Crafter: Feanor</b></h1>
						<p class="description" > Feanor was tending to his horses, when suddenly a fierce storm struck. Much of his herd escaped, even his valued steed, Arbiter. Distraught, he began searching everywhere. Every hill, valley, and glade he left his foot prints. Distraught as he was, he had begun his 
							journey ill prepared. He had brought barely any food and when he ran out, he began to grow hungry. He had sat on a fallen tree, his mind filled with when a hand had reached down to him. He accepted it and allowed it to pull him up. It was Lykos, and in tow he had Feanors horse Arbiter! 
							After discussion, Feanor accepted Lykos proposition to journey to Alya Kemi and help outfit the land with forms of needed transportation. They mounted to horses and rode fast towards the rising sun, towards Alya Kemi. Main occupation: Horse Breeder
