						<h2>Reviews from Members of Alya Kemi</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Ever since my arrival on Alya Kemi, I have been allowed to participate in group projects, games and the like. 
								All of the members of Alya Kemi have welcomed me with open arms and have given me motivation to finish big projects
								and show my creativity. Ultimately, anyone who joins Alya Kemi will be encouraged to participate with others on 
								the realm just by the way the economy works. You are encouraged to pick up a primary occupation, such as farming,
								mining, or anything else, and sell your goods to other members. I have picked up surgar cane farming and am
								in the process of automating the process, which will produce higher yield rates with less work.

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								I have ultimately enjoyed my stay on the Alya Kemi realm. Though death has lain in wait for me
								at every corner, I have managed to enjoy myself and the company of others. I have been on the realm since day 1
								and have since then managed to build one of the loftiest castles in Alya Kemi. The magnificent Throne Room is 
								proof of that fact. Though evil monsters have sought to slow my progress, my mighty fortress has allowed me to
								separate myself from the evil lurking about.

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								I have been involved on the Alya Kemi realm for a long time. So long, in fact, I can not remember 
								the date of my arrival. All I know about my arrival was that it was a long time ago... Since my arrival in Alya Kemi, 
								which, as I say, was a long long time ago, I have managed to establish a blooming industry: cow farming. The economy
								established and protected by our fearless leader, Lykos Sarpedon, has not only allowed, but encouraged an industry such
								as mine to blossom into a strong empire. As such, my industry has developed into a mighty empire of cow herding. 
								Lets just say, I am rich. I am very very rich. I do not know how rich exactly, but I would say I am about as rich
								as the amount of time that I have been on the realm, which as I said, is a very very long time. That's how rich I am.
								Keep in mind, however, my wealth has only been possible due to the economy which has nurtured and encouraged great
								wealth.

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								I am General Sarbina - General of a mighty warring tribe that has been completely exterminated by the evil creeper race. 
								When I came to the realm, Alya Kemi, it was but a small town.
								Thanks to my skills in war and strategy, most of the evil creatures have been put in their proper place: the nether world.
								I have even managed to tolerate the Alya Kemi leader, Lykos Sarpedon, who continues to challenge my superior wisdom in 
								war and strategy. I can not bash too harshly upon Sarpedon, however, as he has managed to unify many strangers together for a common
								cause. This is perhaps the greatest wish of any great leader. Though, while I can not say that I would not be able to do the same,
								I respect his capability and nobility. Though the economy that Sarpedon has established greatly encourages industry, 
								I have not found the need to begin one of my own; nay, I will remain a homeless nomad of the Alya Kemi realm perhaps
								for the rest of my lonesome life. But I will be happy. Yes, thanks to the Alya Kemi realm, I will remain happy.

							<p>
								I am the wild man Feanor. I consider myself to be one with nature. I consider only myself to be worthy of caring for and breeding
								the cousin race &#151; the horse. Though my intent was not wealth, but rather integrity, I have managed to become one of the 
								wealthiest members in the Alya Kemi realm due to the high demand of horses in the flourishing economy and the safe realm.
								Though my industry has been slightly damaged by the railroad empire, I have managed to keep the horse industry alive and well.
