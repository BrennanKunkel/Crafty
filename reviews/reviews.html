							<p>
								Ever since my arrival on Alya Kemi, I have been allowed to participate in group projects, games and the likes. 
								All the members of Alya Kemi have welcomed me with open arms and have given me motivation to finish big projects
								and showing my creativity. Ultimately, anyone who joins Alya Kemi will be encouraged to participate with others on 
								the realm just by the way the economy works. You are encouraged to pick up a primary occupation, such as farming,
								mining, or anything else, and selling your goods to other members. I have picked up surgar cane farming and am
								in the process of automating the process, which will produce higher yeild rates with less work.

							<p>
								I have ultimately enjoyed my stay on the Alya Kemi realm. Though death has lain in wait for me
								at every corner, I have managed to enjoy myself and the company of others. I have been on the realm since day 1
								and have since then managed to build one of the loftiest castles in Alya Kemi. The magnificent Throne Room is 
								proof of that fact. Though evil monsters have sought to slow my progress, my mighty fortress has allowed me to
								separate myself from the evil lurking about.

							<p>
								I have been involved on the Alya Kemi realm for a long time. So long, in fact, I can not remember 
								the date of my arrival. All I know about my arrival was that it was a long time ago... Since my arrival in Alya Kemi, 
								which, as I say, was a long long time ago, I have managed to establish a blooming industry: cow farming. The economy
								established and protected by our fearless leader, Lykos Sarpedon, has not only allowed, but encouraged, industry such
								as mine to blossom into strong empires. As such, my industry has developed into a mighty empire of cow hearding. 
								Lets just say, I am rich. I am very very rich. I do not know how rich exactly, but I would say I am about as rich
								as the amount of time that I have been on the realm, which as I said, is a very very long time. That's how rich I am.
								Keep in mind, however, my wealth has only been possible due to the economy which has nurchered and encouraged great
								wealth.
